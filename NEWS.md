# tsbox 0.0.4 (2018-03-??)

## Changes

- Rectangular structures (data.frame, tibble, data.table, xts) keep explicit NAs
  by default. Use ts_na_omit() to make explict NAs implicit. As previously,
  ts_regular() makes implicit NAs explicit.


## New Functions and Features

- ts_default, new function to change column names to defaults (time, value), so
  that no auto detection is performed afterwards (#118)
- ts_summary, returns a data frame with summary information of a ts-boxable
  object. Also used to extract time series properties (ts_summary(x)$start, ts_summary(x)$freq, etc.)
- ts_regular gains 'fill' argument, to specify replacement value for NA (#101)
- ts_pc, ts_pcy, ts_diff, ts_diffy have been rewritten and are much faster. They
  now return a series of the same lenth as the input, with NAs at the beginning.
- ts_span gains 'extend' argument, to add explicit NAs


## Bug fixes

- ts_apply pass on arguments. This allows functions generated by ts_ to pass on
  aditional arguments. E.g., ts_seas(AirPassengers, x11 = "") (#115, #103)
- unnamed tslist objects of length 1 dont get an id anymore (#116)
- ts_span various fixes, boundary specifcation by shift string ("1 year")
  or period now works as expected, also for non-heuristic series, such as
  EuStockMarkets (#106)
- time column of daily data is treated as Date (#114)
- ts_pick, error if picked series is not in data (#100)
- error when data contains duplicated series (#102)
- ts_plot, improved axis labels for high frequency series (#117)


## Deprecated

- ts_start, ts_end, use ts_summary(x)$start and ts_summary(x)$end instead.

# tsbox 0.0.3 (2018-06-18)

## Features

- Support for tibbletime time series (#90)

## Bug fixes

- Automatically detect numbers or text from 1600 to 2200 as time column (#92)
- Fix to correctly ensure uniqueness of non unique id combinations (#93)
- Fix to correctly parse POSIXct columns for monthly data in different time
  zones. Remove two way testing for daily series with POSIXct columns. This
  should fix mac binary build on CRAN (#97)

# tsbox 0.0.2 (2018-05-12)

## Features

- initial version
