# tsbox 0.0.4 (2018-03-??)

## Changes

- Rectangular structures (data.frame, tibble, data.table, xts) keep explicit NAs
  by default. Use ts_na_omit() to make explict NAs implicit. As previously,
  ts_regular() makes implicit NAs explicit.

## Features

- ts_default, new function to change column names to defaults (time, value), so
  that no auto detection is performed afterwards (#118)
- ts_regular gains 'fill' argument, to specify replacement value for NA (#101)

## Bug fixes

- ts_apply pass on arguments. This allows functions generated by ts_ to pass on
  aditional arguments. E.g., ts_seas(AirPassengers, x11 = "") (#115, #103)
- unnamed tslist objects of length 1 dont get an id anymore (#116)
- ts_span various fixes, boundary specifcation by shift string ("1 year")
  or period now works as expected, also for non-heuristic series, such as
  EuStockMarkets (#106)
- time column of daily data is treated as Date (#114)
- ts_pick, error if picked series is not in data (#100)
- error when data contains duplicated series (#102)


# tsbox 0.0.3 (2018-06-18)

## Features

## Bug fixes

- Automatically detect numbers or text from 1600 to 2200 as time column (#92)
- Fix to correctly ensure uniqueness of non unique id combinations (#93)
- Fix to correctly parse POSIXct columns for monthly data in different time
  zones. Remove two way testing for daily series with POSIXct columns. This
  should fix mac binary build on CRAN (#97)
